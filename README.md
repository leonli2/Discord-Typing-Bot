A Discord Bot that allows you to practice your typing from a topic of your choice! You can choose between getting a text passage from Wikipedia or a Google News article.

# Commands

!type recent [discord_username] -> Shows the most recent typing test result of the User.<br/>

!type graph [discord_username] -> Shows a graph of the most recent typing test results of the User.<br/>
